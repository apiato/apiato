### What is Hello API

Hello API is a **Starter** providing everything to build a modern API-Centric application, with **PHP** and **Laravel 5.3**.

It gives all the common functionalities of a modern API, to help building API-Centric Apps faster.

It uses the best framework, packages, tools and conventions. All configured to work together in a beautiful piece of code.

Setting up an API from scratch takes a lot of time, even with the existence of the many great Technologies and Tools. Hello API saves you time.


### Why API-Centric Apps

Web developers are used to serve HTML pages directly from the Backend. However, this traditional method has many disadvantages in nowadays.

Today we’re living in a digital era, where almost everything is connected to the Internet.

Building cross-devices applications is becoming a must. And to do it, you need APIs (Application Programing Interfaces).

API's can serve anything and everything (Mobile Apps, Web Apps, Smart TVs, Smart Watches,...).
As well as, it can be exposed to the world allowing developers to interact with your Application and help growing your business.

API-Centric Apps allows Frontend (Web + Mobile) and Backend developers to work on their codes in parallel. After the Frontend Apps are ready they get attached to the Backend (API-Centric) code to start functioning. This leads to zero decoupling between the Frontend and the Backend code and also removes the dependencies. The API documentation acts as the contract between both sides during the development life cycle of all the Apps.
